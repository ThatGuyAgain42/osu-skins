# The Plan
so we got the main
the readme will have a displaycase of all the skins
- then we're here
- here we put a folder for the skin name (that were working on)
- ~~(i was thinking about making separate folders for all the preestablished skins but that sounds like a lot of work that we dont need to do. im not sure how well linking the skin file diredctly will turn out but well cross that bridge when we get there) for preestablished skins that __do__ get updated we can clone the file into a new dir and just dump all those files in there~~ we might just have to make new folders for all the old skins so we can include previews...
  - alright then here we have a folder for skins that are wip (when wip skins get finalized we can move them into a new folder under /skins/)
    - and inside we have a folder for the actual dirty raw files
      - raw skin files (that sounds gross out of context)
    - and the actual skin file
